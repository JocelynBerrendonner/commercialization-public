# Annotations

Annotation is a user-defined column in WPA tables. WPA provides two types of annotation: **Dynamic Annotation** and **Legacy Annotation**. Dynamic annotation allows for users to annotate based on AQS queries. Multiple annotation columns can be added and configured independently. Annotations and queries can be persisted in WPA profiles as a part of presets. Legacy Annotation supports annotating on a per-row basis. There can be only one legacy annotation for each row.
