# Annotations

Annotation is a user-defined column in WPA tables. WPA provides two types of annotation: **Dynamic Annotation** and **Legacy Annotation**. Dynamic annotation allows for users to annotate based on AQS queries. Multiple annotation columns can be added and configured independently. Annotations and queries can be persisted in WPA profiles as a part of presets. Legacy Annotation supports annotating on a per-row basis. There can be only one legacy annotation for each row.

## Dynamic Annotation UI
### Configure Annotations
1. In **Analysis View**, open **View Editor**. Select existing annotation columns or drag a new one from **Available Columns**
2. In **Column Details** view, add new or remove/edit existing annotation-query pairs.
